# ploopy-adept

This repository contains my custom **QMK firmware configuration for the Ploopy Adept trackball**.  
It includes advanced features such as:

- Custom pointer acceleration and deceleration
- Drag-scroll mode with hold/tap logic
- Tap dance actions for additional buttons
- Combos for quick navigation keys
- Per-layer pointer behavior
- Custom timers for gestures
- Multi-layer trackball configuration
- Optional userspace-style reusable code

This repo exists to help other Ploopy Adept users who want more advanced behavior than the stock QMK keymaps.
